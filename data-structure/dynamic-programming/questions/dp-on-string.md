##### theory
```
- a subsequence can be consecutive or cannot be consecutive but it always maintain the order

```
-brute force : generate all subseq and compare one by one : exponential in nature
-genrate and compare on the way
-tabulation includes shifting of index
-try to print the dp array and learn how it got filled by looking at the code
-additional ques: also print the lcs subsequence
-additional ques: find longest palindromic subsequence
