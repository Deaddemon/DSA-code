hashing is a technique
applications:
dictionaries
database indexing
cryptography
caches
routers....

direct address table
idea: using keys as indexes
 example: using a boolean array
 it doesnot handle large keys, floating point number,strings, addresses
 coz these cannot be considered as indexes
 

 hash table:a array
 hash functions: converts keys to indexes
 
 collision handling
 chaining 
 open addressing:
 -linear probing
 -quadratic probing
 -double hashing
