 //two ways<br>
 //1: O(n*n) : start from root , find hieght of each node using a height function and then check for condn<br>
 //2: O(n)   : calculating height in the same recursion 
 
 https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/<br>
 //three ways<br>
 //1: O(n*n) : calling height as well as diameter function recursively<br>
 //2: O(n)   : finding height within the diameter function recursive call, no need of calling height function<br>
 //3: O(n)   : adjusting the height function to get the diameter<br>

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/description/<br>
//two approaches:
//1. level order , worst case at perfect BT
//2. root-right-left order , recursive , worst case at skew tree, but they are very less


https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/<br>
 //it is again based on root-right-left order approach
