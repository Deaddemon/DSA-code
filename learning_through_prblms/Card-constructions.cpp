//resources: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lower_bound-in-cpp/

//works on sorted array
//The lower_bound() method in C++ is used to return an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first, last) which has a value not less than val
//The number of comparisons performed is logarithmic. Therefore, the time complexity of the above approach is O(logN),
