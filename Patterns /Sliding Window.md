```c++
int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0;
 // Initialize pointers i and j for the sliding window, and ans to store the maximum window size.

for (; j < N; ++j) {
// Iterate through the array using j as the right boundary of the window.

 // CODE: Use A[j] to update the current state (like sum, count, etc.), which may potentially make the window invalid.
    
    while (invalid()) { // Check if the current window is invalid.
        // If invalid, we need to shrink the window from the left by moving i to the right.
        // CODE: Update the current state by removing the effect of A[i] as we are shrinking the window.
        ++i; // Move the left boundary of the window to the right.
    }
    
    // By now, the window [i, j] is valid, so we check if its size is the largest we've found.
    ans = max(ans, j - i + 1); // Calculate the size of the current window and update ans if this window is larger.
}

return ans; // Return the size of the largest valid window found.
